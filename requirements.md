##Project Name:

MyState

##Business Context:
	
The social media platform aims for users to interact, share, and explore content provided by world leaders. Users can keep up with thoughts that world leaders share throughout this platform while also being able to interact with the community. World leaders also will have access to private conversations with other leaders and will have control over their community, being able to control their subscription to their faction. This platform is aimed to keep individuals entertained with their preferred world leader and allows world leaders to influence their community in any sort of way.

##Problem Statement:

Over the last two decades, interstate conflicts have seen a slight increase from previous levels. There are many things that could be at the root of this increase, but a likely culprit is the lack of communication between world leaders on social media platforms. Current social media platforms allow world leaders to interact with their citizens, but do not actively encourage interaction with other world leaders.A great way to increase peace and lower interstate conflict is to allow world leaders a place to display their country’s greatness, all without a filter and from the comfort of their own governing office.* In the interest of global peace, world leaders must be able to communicate with each other directly, without delay, and without any staff altering their worlds. In short, the problem is that there is too much conflict, and Lockheed Marvin wants to give the world peace.*

##Scope:

This software product will be available by accessing the web server it is hosted on with any desktop device.
	
This software will have a database of users. The information in this database will be served to both primary and secondary users.

Primary users should be able to interact with any other user’s profiles. Secondary users should be able to interact with whatever their primary user allows them to.



##Assumptions:

It is assumed that primary users are significant figures in global politics such as country leaders, (executive leaders, parliament members or provincial governors), global organization administration members or religious leaders. It is also assumed that secondary users are members of the civilian world and are subject to at least one of the primary leader’s jurisdiction/domain.


##Features:
	
Primary users will be able to create a profile. This will have features such as name, age, gender, email, and summary. 

Users can join the website and will be assigned a faction according to their geographic location. Users will be able to vote for a leader of the website. Users will be able to post content and reviews. 

The leader of the website can customize the overall look of the website and theme it to their country. Leaders will also be able to flag content as misleading or treasonous. World Leaders will be able to tax secondary leaders.
	

##Non-Functional Requirements:

Includes Auto refresh, similar to threads and twitter, so that new posts will pop up without the user needing to reload the page. In addition, language-translation capabilities will need to be enabled as users will be from all over the world. (Localization) Also, primary users will be very high profile and will require encryption and their data will need to be inaccessible. Secondary users, not so much. This falls under security. We will also need to ensure that MyState is accessible from different mediums, such as from an Iphone to a PC. A dark mode/themes may also be implemented for some users that prefer certain colorscapes depending on their country of origin. 

*Lockheed Marvin is not responsible for an increase in interstate conflicts due to world leaders interacting directly through the internet. Lockheed Marvin is not responsible for potential loss of life, property, or dignity. Lockheed Marvin is not responsible for global thermonuclear warfare.
*Lockheed Marvin is not required to tell the truth. It is in Lockheed Marvin’s interests to produce profits for itself and shareholders, even if it means lying to the public.
